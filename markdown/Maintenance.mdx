## What is Maintenance?
Maintenance refers to the regular and proactive efforts taken to preserve, repair, and sustain the condition of architectural structures. It involves a range of activities aimed at preventing deterioration, identifying and addressing issues in a timely manner, and ensuring that buildings and their components continue to perform as intended. Maintenance encompasses routine tasks, inspections, repairs, and the implementation of preventive measures to maintain the value and functionality of architectural assets.
