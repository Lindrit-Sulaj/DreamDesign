## What is Exterior Design?
Exterior design focuses on creating visually appealing and harmonious exteriors for buildings, landscapes, and outdoor environments. It involves combining architectural elements, landscaping, materials, textures, and colors to achieve an aesthetically pleasing and cohesive look. Exterior design aims to complement the surrounding environment, reflect the purpose and style of the structure, and optimize functionality while maintaining structural integrity.

## How Exterior Design Works
At DreamDesign, we follow a collaborative and comprehensive approach to exterior design, ensuring that every aspect of your project is meticulously planned and executed. Our process includes the following key steps:
